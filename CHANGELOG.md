# Changelog

## Unreleased — Phase 0 + Phase 1

First working generator. Implements DESIGN.md §8's Phase 0 (generator side) and
Phase 1 in full.

### Added

- **CLI** (`bb.edn` + `clogem.cli`) — `build`, `dev`, `serve`, `clean`,
  `doctor`, `fm-fix`, `test`, using quickblog's ns-metadata spec pattern so
  option parsing, `--help` and defaults come from one definition per task.
  Designed for `bb --config /path/to/clogem-press/bb.edn <task>` from the
  content directory.
- **Config** (`clogem.config`) — load, deep-merge (defaults < site.edn < CLI),
  normalize and validate. Language codes are canonicalized and indexed
  case-insensitively. Validation covers the mandatory giscus `data-lang` mapping
  and the `:generator :min-version` compatibility floor.
- **Scanner** (`clogem.scan`) — §6.1's amended parsing algorithm: numbered
  directories, language suffixes closed over the configured `:langs`,
  case-insensitive matching with canonical storage, near-miss language codes as
  hard errors with edit-distance suggestions, and the identity-scoped
  duplicate-number rule.
- **Front matter** (`clogem.frontmatter`) — YAML and EDN read; surgical
  auto-fill that inserts only missing keys and never reserializes the block;
  CRLF and BOM preserved.
- **Model** (`clogem.model`) — identity groups by permalink, resolved implicitly
  by (directory, order, filename base) or explicitly by a shared `permalink:`;
  primary-variant selection from `:priority`; permalink minting with collision
  checks; variant permalink inheritance; `permalinks.edn` ledger; deterministic
  read-only fallback URLs.
- **Markdown** (`clogem.markdown`) — nextjournal/markdown with renderer
  overrides: raw HTML passthrough, heading anchors from pre-computed slugs,
  permalink-aware link rewriting with dead-link warnings.
- **Theme** (`clogem.theme.*`) — navbar with language switcher, flat sidebar,
  article page, per-article variant bar, fallback notices, `<html lang>` per
  variant, five sets of UI strings, and a CSS-variables stylesheet with the
  `:lang()` font stacks of §6.9.
- **Export** (`clogem.render`) — the §6.3 URL scheme, redirect stubs under
  `:prefix-default? true`, asset copying.
- **Dev server** (`clogem.dev`) — http-kit, a vendored static handler, SSE live
  reload, and a `--poll` watcher that the fswatcher pod falls back to
  automatically.
- **`examples/demo-site`** — a five-language fixture exercising every
  convention, plus `doctor-cases/` holding the filenames that are *supposed* to
  fail.
- **Tests** — 97 tests / 295 assertions: golden-file front-matter write-back,
  parser table tests reproducing §6.1's worked examples, identity-group
  resolution, and CJK/Tamil heading-slug characterization.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — tests, then two demo builds
  (`--no-write` and normal) each followed by `git diff --exit-code`, then
  `doctor`, then assertions on the emitted URL scheme.

### Design changes made during implementation

Recorded in DESIGN.md in the same commit:

- **Identity uses the filename base, not the display title.** §6.2 said
  "(directory, order, title)"; the first demo build proved that must mean the
  title parsed from the *filename*, since a translation almost always sets a
  translated `title:` — keying on the display title gave every translated file
  its own permalink and silently defeated the i18n design.
- **`:giscus` presence is required only when giscus is the provider**; an
  unroutable *value* is an error whenever one is present.
- **Heading slugs are not GitHub-style.** nextjournal/markdown preserves
  punctuation. CJK and Tamil survive verbatim, which retires the risk the design
  flagged; a whitespace repair is applied uniformly to heading ids and the TOC.
- **Errors are collected and reported together** rather than raised at the first
  offender.
